## Data Strutures

- ### Arrays

  - Implement an automatically resizing vector.

    - [Resizing arrays (video)](https://archive.org/details/0102WhatYouShouldKnow/03_01-resizableArrays.mp4)
  - [x] Implement a vector (mutable array with automatic resizing):
    - [x] Practice coding using arrays and pointers, and pointer math to jump to an index instead of using indexing.
    - [x] new raw data array with allocated memory
      - can allocate int array under the hood, just not use its features
      - start with 16, or if starting number is greater, use power of 2 - 16, 32, 64, 128
    - [x] size() - number of items
    - [x] capacity() - number of items it can hold
    - [x] is_empty()
    - [x] at(index) - returns item at given index, blows up if index out of bounds
    - [x] push(item)
    - [x] insert(index, item) - inserts item at index, shifts that index's value and trailing elements to the right
    - [x] prepend(item) - can use insert above at index 0
    - [x] pop() - remove from end, return value
    - [x] delete(index) - delete item at index, shifting all trailing elements left
    - [x] remove(item) - looks for value and removes index holding it (even if in multiple places)
    - [x] find(item) - looks for value and returns first index with that value, -1 if not found
    - [x] resize(new_capacity) // private function
      - when you reach capacity, resize to double the size
      - when popping an item, if size is 1/4 of capacity, resize to half
  - [x] Time
    - O(1) to add/remove at end (amortized for allocations for more space), index, or update
    - O(n) to insert/remove elsewhere
  - [x] Space
    - contiguous in memory, so proximity helps performance
    - space needed = (array capacity, which is >= n) \* size of item, but even if 2n, still O(n)

- ### Linked Lists

  - [ ] Description:

  - [ ] [C Code (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN6FPiD0Gzo) - not the whole video, just portions about Node struct and memory allocation.
  - [ ] Linked List vs Arrays:
    - [Core Linked Lists Vs Arrays (video)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures-optimizing-performance/lecture/rjBs9/core-linked-lists-vs-arrays)
    - [In The Real World Linked Lists Vs Arrays (video)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures-optimizing-performance/lecture/QUaUd/in-the-real-world-lists-vs-arrays)
  - [ ] [why you should avoid linked lists (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQs6IC-vgmo)
  - [ ] Gotcha: you need pointer to pointer knowledge:
        (for when you pass a pointer to a function that may change the address where that pointer points)
        This page is just to get a grasp on ptr to ptr. I don't recommend this list traversal style. Readability and maintainability suffer due to cleverness.
    - [Pointers to Pointers](https://www.eskimo.com/~scs/cclass/int/sx8.html)
  - [ ] implement (I did with tail pointer & without):
    - [ ] size() - returns number of data elements in list
    - [ ] empty() - bool returns true if empty
    - [ ] value_at(index) - returns the value of the nth item (starting at 0 for first)
    - [ ] push_front(value) - adds an item to the front of the list
    - [ ] pop_front() - remove front item and return its value
    - [ ] push_back(value) - adds an item at the end
    - [ ] pop_back() - removes end item and returns its value
    - [ ] front() - get value of front item
    - [ ] back() - get value of end item
    - [ ] insert(index, value) - insert value at index, so current item at that index is pointed to by new item at index
    - [ ] erase(index) - removes node at given index
    - [ ] value_n_from_end(n) - returns the value of the node at nth position from the end of the list
    - [ ] reverse() - reverses the list
    - [ ] remove_value(value) - removes the first item in the list with this value
  - [ ] Doubly-linked List
    - [Description (video)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures/lecture/jpGKD/doubly-linked-lists)
    - No need to implement

- ### Stack

  - [ ] [Stacks (video)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures/lecture/UdKzQ/stacks)
  - [ ] [Using Stacks Last-In First-Out (video)](https://archive.org/details/0102WhatYouShouldKnow/05_01-usingStacksForLast-inFirst-out.mp4)
  - [ ] Will not implement. Implementing with array is trivial.

- ### Queue

  - [ ] [Using Queues First-In First-Out(video)](https://archive.org/details/0102WhatYouShouldKnow/05_03-usingQueuesForFirst-inFirst-out.mp4)
  - [ ] [Queue (video)](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/data-structures/queues-EShpq)
  - [ ] [Circular buffer/FIFO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_buffer)
  - [ ] [Priority Queues (video)](https://archive.org/details/0102WhatYouShouldKnow/05_04-priorityQueuesAndDeques.mp4)
  - [ ] Implement using linked-list, with tail pointer:
    - enqueue(value) - adds value at position at tail
    - dequeue() - returns value and removes least recently added element (front)
    - empty()
  - [ ] Implement using fixed-sized array:
    - enqueue(value) - adds item at end of available storage
    - dequeue() - returns value and removes least recently added element
    - empty()
    - full()
  - [ ] Cost:
    - a bad implementation using linked list where you enqueue at head and dequeue at tail would be O(n)
      because you'd need the next to last element, causing a full traversal each dequeue
    - enqueue: O(1) (amortized, linked list and array [probing])
    - dequeue: O(1) (linked list and array)
    - empty: O(1) (linked list and array)

- ### Hash table

    - add(key, value) - if key already exists, update value
    - exists(key)
    - get(key)
    - remove(key)
